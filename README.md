## Installation
I'll make the plugin accessible for anybody later. In order to start it locally you have to:
1. Download the plugin and unzip the files or simply git clone it.
2. Move the folder to your Obsidian plugins directory: `your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/`
3. Open terminal in that folder and run ```npm run dev```. It should create a main.js file (that's the way to check if it's compiled).
4. In Obsidian, go to `Settings > Community plugins`, and make sure `Safe mode` is off.
5. Click on `Browse`, search for this plugin (Read-time), and enable it unless it's already in your library.
